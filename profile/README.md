# üöÄ Subcoin Project

Subcoin is an open-source, public-good project designed to contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem with innovative technologies that enhance the Bitcoin network's accessibility and scalability.

## üîë Key Features

- **Subcoin Node**

  A Rust-based implementation of the Bitcoin protocol built on the [Polkadot-SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) framework. Subcoin node offers **Decentralized Bitcoin Fast Sync**, a feature that enables new Bitcoin participants to quickly catch up with the latest Bitcoin state without needing to download and verify every block from the genesis. This drastically reduces the time and computational resources required to join the Bitcoin network, making it easier for newcomers to participate.

- **Snapcake**

  **Snapcake** is a trustless UTXO snapshot provider for Bitcoin Core. With Snapcake, users can download a Bitcoin Core-compatible UTXO snapshot directly from the Subcoin P2P network, without running a Subcoin node. This tool enhances Bitcoin Core by eliminating the need for trusted snapshot providers, making the process of syncing with the Bitcoin network more secure and decentralized.
